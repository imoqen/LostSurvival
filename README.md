This is the git repository for my A-Level Computer Science NEA Project,\
 "Lost Survival".\
This is a 3D, infinite procedurally generated world filled with randomly spawning zombies - the goal is to survive. The game also features a "peaceful" mode - suitable for children - where the goal is to collect gems within the infinite world, before the time runs out.\
This project, along with its documentation, scored an A* grade at A-Level.

## Video
After completing this project, I created a YouTube video to illustrate how the game works.
The video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlWSv2Or1Gs).
